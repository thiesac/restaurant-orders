# Restaurant Project üçù üçõ

This project was developed as part of my studies at Trybe and it aims to practice and apply important concepts, including Hashmaps using Python's `Dict` and `Set` data structures, software testing, and object-oriented programming.

## Exercised Skills

- Practice of the Hashmaps concept using Python's Dict and Set data structures.
- Application of software testing knowledge.
- Utilization of object-oriented programming concepts.

## 1. Testing Implemented Classes Part 1

In this phase, tests have been implemented for the `Ingredient` class, located in the `src/models/ingredient.py` module.

## 2. Testing Implemented Classes Part 2

The second phase involves the implementation of tests for the `Dish` class, found in the `src/models/dish.py` module.

## 3. Mapping Dishes <> Ingredients

The class `MenuData` was implemented in the `src/services/menu_data.py` module .

## 4. Menu Generation

Completed the implementation of the `get_main_menu` method, which generates the main menu, avoiding dishes with a specific dietary restriction.
